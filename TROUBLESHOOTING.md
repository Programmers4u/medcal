# Installation Troubleshooting

# Quick Checking Your Revision

## Make sure your system meets the requirements

  - Check [requirements](INSTALLING.md#requirements)

## Verify that your current revision is passing tests

  - [ ] Get the current revision number: `git rev-parse HEAD`
  - [ ] Verify that your [current revision is passing tests](https://travis-ci.org/timegridio/timegrid/builds)
  - [ ] If not passing, use a *build passing revision*

# Specific problems

## Uncaught exception 'ReflectionException' when running artisan

### Problem

When trying to install, I get this error every time I want to run any `php artisan` command.

```
Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'ReflectionException' with message 'Class log does not exist
```

### Background

It seems that `dev` packages are not installed and Laravel complains when it tries to load them, so the solution is to
install them with composer if you are on a development environment.

### Solution

Run `composer install --dev` instead of `composer install`

## Call to undefined function locale_get_primary_language()

### Problem

### Solution

[Install PHP intl](http://php.net/manual/en/intl.installation.php)

## This cache store does not support tagging.

### Problem

Getting the error *This cache store does not support tagging.*, specially after 
registering a business.

In your `.env` file you probably have `CACHE_DRIVER=file`

### Solution

Edit your `.env` file and set `CACHE_DRIVER=array`
