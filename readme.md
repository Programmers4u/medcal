### Author Notes

:warning: **IMPORTANT NOTE**

Dear tiny but human-qualified community,

Timegrid was born as a pet project and aimed to solve my own needs as a freelancer.
I'm also happy to hear that medical helped to solve a problem for others, at least partially.

That said, I'm sorry to mention that currently overloaded with other projects, I won't be
able to keep up on medical development on a fulltime basis like before.

PR's and other contributions, as well as regular maintenance will still take place.

Thanks for your patience and thanks for being around.

## Special Thanks & Credits

May all beings be happy.
